\vspace{0.5cm}

The emergence of 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) networks has introduced unprecedented challenges in ensuring reliable service delivery through network slicing. This paper presents a novel deep learning approach to anomaly detection in network slices using autoencoder neural networks. Our system processes multiple network performance metrics to automatically identify abnormal behavior patterns that could impact service quality. By analyzing network traffic patterns across bandwidth, packet rates, delay, jitter, loss rates, and throughput, our approach demonstrates high accuracy in detecting anomalies while maintaining low false positive rates. The proposed solution offers real-time monitoring capabilities with minimal computational overhead, making it suitable for practical deployment in B5G environments. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of the autoencoder-based approach in capturing complex relationships between network metrics, providing a robust foundation for automated network slice monitoring and management.

\section{Introduction}
The emergence of Fifth Generation (5G) and Beyond 5G (B5G) networks marks a revolutionary shift in telecommunications, introducing unprecedented capabilities and challenges. At the forefront of this evolution is network slicing, a transformative technology that enables multiple virtual networks to operate on shared physical infrastructure. While this advancement offers remarkable flexibility in service delivery, it also brings forth complex challenges in monitoring and maintaining network health.

Network slicing represents a paradigm shift in how network resources are allocated and managed. Each virtual slice operates as an independent network, tailored to serve specific applications with distinct requirements. From ultra-reliable low-latency communications supporting autonomous vehicles to massive machine-type communications enabling smart cities, these virtual networks must consistently deliver optimal performance. This diversity in service requirements creates a unique challenge in monitoring and detecting anomalies that could compromise service quality.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The fundamental challenge lies in developing a system that can:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automatically learn and adapt to normal behavior patterns within each network slice
    \item Detect anomalies in real-time without generating excessive false alarms
    \item Scale effectively across multiple network slices with varying QoS requirements
    \item Operate with minimal human intervention while maintaining high accuracy
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Contributions}
The key contributions of our work include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development of an efficient autoencoder architecture for network monitoring
    \item Implementation of a practical approach to real-time anomaly detection
    \item Creation of a scalable framework for network slice management
    \item Comprehensive evaluation using real network traffic data
\end{itemize}

Singh et al. \cite{ref2} presented a comprehensive analysis of security concerns and opportunities in 5G network slicing, while De Alwis et al. \cite{ref3} conducted an extensive survey on network slicing security, covering attacks, challenges, and potential solutions. In the context of intelligent network management, Yeh et al. \cite{ref4} demonstrated the application of deep learning for automated network slicing in 5G Open RAN deployments. Javadpour et al. \cite{ref5} proposed a reinforcement learning approach for slice isolation against DDoS attacks, and Liu and Chou \cite{ref6} developed a staged reinforcement learning framework for B5G network slice management. The implementation aspects of network slicing were addressed by Chirivella-Perez et al. \cite{ref7}, who presented an end-to-end slice management framework for multi-tenant networks. Recent surveys by Rafique et al. \cite{ref8} and Wijethilaka and Liyanage \cite{ref9} have highlighted the growing importance of network slicing in smart cities and future networks. The security aspects of 5G networks have been extensively studied, with Salahdine et al. \cite{ref10} and Dangi et al. \cite{ref11} providing comprehensive surveys on security challenges and machine learning-based solutions. Fundamental concepts and challenges in network slicing were explored by Foukas et al. \cite{ref13} and Kostas et al. \cite{ref14}, while Zhang et al. \cite{ref15} addressed mobility and resource management challenges. Machine learning applications in network management have been investigated by Li et al. \cite{ref18} and Ayala-Romero et al. \cite{ref19}, with specific focus on anomaly detection in network slicing. Recent work by Liu et al. \cite{ref22} demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning-based approaches for anomaly detection in 5G network slicing. Security and privacy concerns in network slicing have been addressed by Naeem and Jamalipour \cite{ref23}, while resource allocation strategies were explored by Vassilaras et al. \cite{ref24}. The integration of zero trust architecture in 5G networks has been studied by Khan and Liang \cite{ref29} and Bernabe et al. \cite{ref30}, offering new perspectives on network security. Comprehensive security frameworks and future directions have been proposed by Yin et al. \cite{ref35} and Salama et al. \cite{ref36}, emphasizing the role of artificial intelligence in network security.
